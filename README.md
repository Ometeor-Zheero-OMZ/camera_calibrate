# Camera Calibration

This is a demo for camera calibration.

I'm a beginner in computer vision and still learning about this field.

## Pictures

I took multiple pictures of a chessboard from different angles, up to 14 in total.

If you want to calibrate your camera, I recommend capturing at least 20 images, as suggested by standard camera calibration methods.

I assume that the dataset I used is not ideal for this demo.

I probably need more distorted images, like this:

The input and output shown below are expected to remain unchanged.
