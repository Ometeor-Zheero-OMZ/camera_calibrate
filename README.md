# Camera Calibration

This is a camera calibration demo.

I'm a beginner at a computer vision, so sill learn this field.

## Pictures

I shoot some pictures of a chessboard from many angles up to 14.

If you tru to calibrate your camera, I recommend you to gather more than 20 pictures according to a common camera calibration pattern.

And these input and output down below mightn't be changed.

I assume that dataset that I used is not a appropriate for this demo. 

Probably, I need more distorted pictures like this:
